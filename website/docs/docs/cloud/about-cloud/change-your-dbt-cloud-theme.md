# Change your dbt Cloud theme <Lifecycle status="preview" />

dbt Cloud supports **Light mode** (default), **Dark mode**, and **System mode** (respects your browser's theme for light or dark mode) under the **Theme** section of your user profile. You can seamlessly switch between these modes directly from the profile menu, customizing your viewing experience.

Your selected theme is stored in your user profile, ensuring a consistent experience across dbt Cloud.

Theme selection applies across all areas of dbt Cloud, including the [IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud), [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects), [environments](/docs/environments-in-dbt), [jobs](/docs/deploy/jobs), and more. Learn more about customizing themes in [Enable dark mode in dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/dark-mode#enable-dark-mode-in-dbt-cloud).

## Prerequisites

- You have a dbt Cloud account. If you don’t, try [dbt Cloud for free!](https://www.getdbt.com/signup)
- Dark mode is currently available on the Developer plan and will gradually be made available for all [plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) in the future. Stay tuned for updates.

## Disable dark mode in dbt Cloud

To disable dark mode in the dbt Cloud UI, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the three dots at the bottom right of the IDE.
2. Select **Switch to light mode** from the menu.

## Legacy dark mode

The **Switch to dark mode** menu item in the IDE will soon be deprecated. All users who have access to the IDE will default to **Light mode** upon signing in, but can easily switch to **Dark mode** from the user menu in the navigation. Once you switch to your new theme, it will apply to all of your devices.
